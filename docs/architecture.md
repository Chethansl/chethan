## Components

### 1. API Layer (app.py, server.py)

The API layer handles HTTP requests and responses, providing a RESTful interface for the frontend to interact with the backend services. It is implemented using Flask, with the option to switch to FastAPI for better performance.

**Key Features:**
- RESTful API endpoints
- Request validation
- Error handling
- CORS support
- Logging
- Health checks

**Scalability Considerations:**
- Can be deployed behind a load balancer
- Supports multiple worker processes
- Can be containerized for easy deployment

### 2. Diagnosis Engine (diagnose.py)

The Diagnosis Engine is responsible for predicting diseases based on symptoms. It uses a Random Forest classifier trained on the SymbiPredict dataset.

**Key Features:**
- Symptom-based disease prediction
- Confidence scores for predictions
- Symptom importance analysis
- Related symptom suggestions

**Technical Details:**
- Uses scikit-learn's RandomForestClassifier
- Supports severity-weighted symptoms
- Configurable confidence thresholds

### 3. Progression Predictor (predict_progress.py)

The Progression Predictor forecasts how a disease will progress over time, with and without treatment. It uses mathematical models to simulate disease progression.

**Key Features:**
- Time-based progression prediction
- Multiple scenarios (typical, optimistic, untreated)
- Patient-specific adjustments

**Technical Details:**
- Exponential decay model for treatment scenarios
- Patient factors (age, comorbidities, etc.) influence predictions
- Configurable time points and severity scale

### 4. Feedback Agent (feedback_agent.py)

The Feedback Agent collects and processes user feedback to improve the model over time. It implements a feedback-based learning mechanism.

**Key Features:**
- Feedback collection and validation
- Model retraining based on feedback
- Feedback statistics and learning curve analysis

**Technical Details:**
- Incremental learning when possible
- Configurable retraining thresholds
- Memory management for feedback data

### 5. Data Layer (datasets/)

The Data Layer handles data loading, preprocessing, and management. It includes the SymbiPredict dataset and preprocessing functions.

**Key Features:**
- Data cleaning and normalization
- Symptom-disease mapping
- Feature extraction

**Technical Details:**
- CSV-based dataset
- Preprocessing pipeline for model training
- Data validation and cleaning

## Data Flow

1. **Diagnosis Flow:**
   - Frontend sends symptoms to the API
   - API forwards the request to the Diagnosis Engine
   - Diagnosis Engine predicts diseases and returns results
   - API returns the results to the Frontend

2. **Progression Prediction Flow:**
   - Frontend sends disease and initial severity to the API
   - API forwards the request to the Progression Predictor
   - Progression Predictor forecasts disease progression
   - API returns the results to the Frontend

3. **Feedback Flow:**
   - Frontend sends feedback to the API
   - API forwards the feedback to the Feedback Agent
   - Feedback Agent validates and stores the feedback
   - Feedback Agent retrains the model if necessary
   - API returns success/failure to the Frontend

## Design Decisions

### 1. Random Forest Classifier

We chose Random Forest for disease prediction because:
- It handles high-dimensional data well
- It provides feature importance scores
- It is robust to overfitting
- It can handle both categorical and numerical features

### 2. Flask/FastAPI

We implemented the API using Flask with the option to switch to FastAPI because:
- Flask is simple and easy to understand
- FastAPI offers better performance and automatic documentation
- Both support CORS, request validation, and error handling

### 3. Feedback-Based Learning

We implemented a feedback mechanism to:
- Continuously improve the model
- Adapt to new patterns and edge cases
- Provide transparency through learning curves and statistics

### 4. Modular Architecture

We designed the system with a modular architecture to:
- Separate concerns and responsibilities
- Enable independent development and testing
- Allow for easy replacement of components
- Support scalability and maintainability

## Scaling Considerations

### 1. Horizontal Scaling

The system can be horizontally scaled by:
- Deploying multiple instances behind a load balancer
- Using a shared database for feedback data
- Implementing a distributed training mechanism

### 2. Vertical Scaling

The system can be vertically scaled by:
- Increasing the number of worker processes
- Optimizing the model for better performance
- Using more efficient data structures and algorithms

### 3. Caching

Performance can be improved through caching:
- Caching common diagnosis results
- Caching progression predictions
- Implementing a Redis cache for API responses

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced ML Models:**
   - Deep learning models for better accuracy
   - Ensemble methods combining multiple models
   - Time-series models for progression prediction

2. **Real-time Analytics:**
   - Dashboard for model performance monitoring
   - Real-time feedback analysis
   - A/B testing for model improvements

3. **Integration Capabilities:**
   - Electronic Health Record (EHR) integration
   - Mobile app support
   - Third-party API integrations

4. **Enhanced Security:**
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Data encryption
   - HIPAA compliance measures
